![under construction](https://openclipart.org/image/300px/svg_to_png/293844/under-construction_geek_man_01.png "Under construction")

This repository is under heavy construction. Details on how to build and use
will be provided soon.

## Goals

This repository provides utilities for enhancing and processing GPX (XML GPS
track) files. The first language of choice is *Ada* for numerous reasons. Future
work may introduce some other good languages.

### Planned features are:

- [ ] add elevation information to GPX data

- [ ] add speed information to the GPX data

- [ ] produce elevation and speed graphs

- [ ] produce statistics (avg. speed, total climb/descend,...)
